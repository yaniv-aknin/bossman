bossman
-------

Develop Procfile based applications.

Bossman is similar to [David Dollar's](http://daviddollar.org/) [Foreman](http://ddollar.github.com/foreman/), only it's meant to be more oriented towards development than towards actual production use (i.e., develop with Bossman, deploy on Heroku, etc). At the time of this writing it has no benefit over Foreman, but I have some ideas I'd like to explore with it in the future.

It's written in Python/Twisted, it's MIT licensed, and I'm [`@aknin`](http://twitter.com/#!/aknin), if you want to talk.
